# 3D Spheres Rendering Application

## Overview

This repository contains a windowed application that renders a grid of 36 spheres using a specified shading model. The application utilizes an orthographic camera for rendering and provides interactive features such as changing sphere colors on mouse-click events.

## Completed Deliverables

**Sphere Rendering Application:**
1. **Initial Setup:**
    - [ ] Create a windowed application that renders 36 spheres in a 6x6 grid-like pattern.

2. **Shading:**
    - [ X ]  Applied a shading model to the spheres.
    - [ ] Used an orthographic camera for consistent visibility.

3. **Parameter Variation:**
    - [ ] Choose any 2 parameters of the shading model.
    - [ ] Have these parameters change linearly over the two axes (left to right, and top to bottom).

4. **Interactive Color Change:**
    - [ ] Register mouse-click events.
    - [ ] Change the color of the clicked sphere to the normal color at that point.

5. **Deselection and Exit:**
    - [ ] Deselect the sphere and return to normal when a click event occurs outside any sphere.
    - [ ] Trigger application exit on pressing the ESC key.
