# 3D Spheres Rendering Application

## Overview

This repository contains the codebase for a simple application in OpenGL written in Python. The following features are available in this application.

### Completed Deliverables
**Sphere Rendering Application:**
1. **Initial Setup:**
    - [✅] Create a windowed application that renders 36 spheres in a 6x6 grid-like pattern.
2. **Shading:**
    - [✅]  Applied a shading model to the spheres.
    - [✅] Used an orthographic camera for consistent visibility.

3. **Parameter Variation:**
    - [✅] Choose any 2 parameters of the shading model and have these parameters change linearly over the two axes (left to right, and top to bottom).

4. **Interactive Color Change:**
    - [✅] Register mouse-click events that trigger a color change of the clicked sphere to the normal color at that point colorised.

5. **Deselection and Exit:**
    - [✅] Register mouse-click to deselect the previous change on the sphere and return to normal when a click event occurs outside any sphere.
    - [✅] Trigger application exit by pressing the ESC key.
